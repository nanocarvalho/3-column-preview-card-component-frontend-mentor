## My process
This time I tried using grid, it was fun! The process was simple, as the cards are the same, the html was simplified, as well as the css, I've just needed to add little individual stuff, like the colors of each one.

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup(kinda)
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
